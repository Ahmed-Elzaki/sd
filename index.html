        <p class="text-block">My name is Ahmed Elzaki. I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.uofk.edu/" class="links">Khartoum University</a>, where I completed one year with a GPA of 3.4. However, my true passion has always been in computer and software engineering, a field Ive been fascinated by since childhood. I began programming with Scratch when I was just 12 years old, which ignited my love for creating and problem-solving through code.
            I am multilingual, fluent in Arabic, English, and I can speak Japanese, which helps me connect with diverse communities and resources. I am eager to continue developing my skills and knowledge in software engineering, driven by the same curiosity and enthusiasm that first led me to programming.
          </p> 
        <p  class="text-block">I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong passion for game development. I have earned a Software Engineering certificate from the <a href="https://coursera.org/specializations/software-engineering" class="links" title="show course details">Hong Kong University (HKUST)</a> and a specialization in c/c++ from <a href="https://coursera.org/specializations/coding-for-everyone" class="links" title="show course details">university of California Santa Cruz</a>  on Coursera, and I am currently furthering my skills through Backend Development by Meta. My journey into software development has been driven by a love for problem-solving and creating interactive experiences.
            I have hands-on experience in game development, particularly using the Godot engine, where I have brought my ideas to life in the form of engaging games. I am continually expanding my knowledge and expertise, aiming to build a career where I can blend my technical skills with my creative passions.
